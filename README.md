CORDTRA-R
=========

Making CORDTRA (chronologically-ordered representation of discourse and tool-related activities) diagrams with R and shiny.

## Context

Learning scientists usually need to analyze student interaction data in online collaborative environments. In a typical research, they will conduct content analysis of student discourse or activities according to a bunch of interesting coding schemes. After all this hard work is done, one significant challenge for researchers is to interpret coding results to answer their research questions.

CORDTRA diagrams provide an alternative to help researchers visually interpret learning activities or discourse moves. More information about this technique can be found in the articles below.
