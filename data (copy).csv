Usually, organisms try to maintain a balance between reproduction and death. These is the reason why animals who live a short period of time have more babies than the ones who live longer. Since they die faster, they need to preserve the species, and if they live longer, they need to prevent overpopulation. I hope I helped you :)","T",,4,2,2,"P"

45,"02/05/2013 12:25:14","Welcome 6A","answer for laura ","u13","A growing population leads to several environmental issues as well as social problems. An increasing population can be attributed to several variables. Within countries, we can credit the growth to increased immigration or lack of migration. Lack of education and contraceptive use and the need or desire for more children also adds to the population. In more developed countries we can attribute the population rises to better medical care, thus a longer lifespan and/or fewer deaths. As a result of this overpopulation we experience social issues such as increased rates of poverty, crime, disease, and environmental problems such as increased global warming, natural disasters, loss of habitat, pollution, and more. These threats are very necessary to be addressed, as they will affect people worldwide.

People excrete wastes and this contaminates water currents, leading to people that can't drink it due to its contamination levels, or can't either bathe or brush their teeth. Besides, forests are being cut off since the need of space for our expanding popoulation. Global warming is another problem, since more people cause more greenhouse gases which lead to the greenhouse effect,the heating of Earth, and the polution of air, causing diseases. Cities gorwth rate will make people torn down forest, and this will end habitats, which will end by the extinction of species. According to http://geojoedr.tripod.com/id3.html ,this urban expansion deplete the Earth's resources, in Africa, 2 billion hectares of arable land have already been lost.This page says: ""In Nigeria alone, 351,000 ha of land are being removed every year."" In terms of economy, resources will not be enough for everyone, and probably to prevent starvation, tthe affected country will rely in foreign resources, putting itself on debt. There will be a lot of unemployment, since there are not enough jobs to support the population, and this will lead people to steal in order to survive.

This big class contains: parasitism, mutualism, commensalism and amensalism. There are differences between all this subclasses. For example: in parasitism the parasites are somewhat like a predator so it gets benefict while the host is weakened meanwhile the mutualism is when many species depend on another for survival, they all get beneficts. So, this interactions can affect the growth rate. For example: in parasitism, the growth rate of the host will decrease but the growth rate of parasites will increase because  what it´s doing favourates it. ","E",,,,,

This is a really interesting question, however,  if by ""Carrying Capacity of humans"" you mean the maximum number of bacteria that a human can support, or the number of humans the Earth can support.

Remember that this is ""a term used by ecologists to describe the maximum number of animals of a given species that a habitat can support indefinitely, without permanently degrading the environment."" http://www.umac.org/ocp/CarryingCapacity/info.html, Uppac Midwest Aerospace Consortium. I'll answer the most likely question to me, which is the one of our planet's carrying capacity. According to that last page, scientists now believe that Earth's carrying capacity if approximately of 12 billion people. This means that population levels are increasing in an amazingly fast rate, since we already passed the middle.

This huge worldwide problem is very worrying because it doesn´t have a proper solution, there is not yet an exact answer of how we can improve this. But people thinks or invent some tips that can help us. When I search of this topic the majority of pages said that educations is the best plan for the future of OVERPOPULATION, so I think that if we teach a little community that do not knows about what are the big causes of overpopulation and fall on account maybe if they have dedication they can change something of this problem.

I also learned that animals have different reproductive capacity from us, ants have a very short life and they reproduce in a very very fast way while we have a very long life but we don't reproduce so much.

Within this worldwidew issue, I've improved my thinking and the way I managed populations, for example, I´ve judged the world´s situation and concluded that if we don´t stop, we could exceed the carrying capacity, and this would cause the crash of not only humans, but of all the species on Earth.
The most exciting findings were, in my opinion, the way that populations can change within the density dependent factors and their competition among other organisms and the fact that the Earth, as every space in it, has a carrying capacity, and the only way for us not to exceed it is compromise, and it only depends on us, humans.
The ideas that didn't get to anything were the ones that already had an answer. For example, the country with the largest population. That is not an interesting question that requires an investigation, that requires discussion. It has an answer, it's a fact.
I would like working on population dynamics, the way they change with the different factors that affect them, the relationships between organisms.
